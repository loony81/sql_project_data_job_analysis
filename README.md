# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
```sql
SELECT job_id, job_title, job_location, job_schedule_type, salary_year_avg, 
job_posted_date, name as company_name
FROM job_postings_fact p
JOIN company_dim c ON p.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND job_location = 'Anywhere' 
AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs_cte AS (
    SELECT job_id, job_title, salary_year_avg, name as company_name
    FROM job_postings_fact p
    JOIN company_dim c ON p.company_id = c.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND job_location = 'Anywhere' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT sj.job_id, job_title, salary_year_avg, company_name, skills 
FROM top_paying_jobs_cte cte
JOIN skills_job_dim sj ON cte.job_id = sj.job_id
JOIN skills_dim s on sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
```
Here's an analysis of the skills required for the top 10 data analyst roles based on the job postings. 
Most Frequently Mentioned Skills:
- **SQL**: 7 mentions

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.
```sql
SELECT skills, COUNT(sj.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact p
JOIN skills_job_dim sj ON p.job_id = sj.job_id
JOIN skills_dim s on sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
AND job_work_from_home
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023
- **SQL** and **Excel** remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
- **Programming** and **Visualization Tools** like **Python**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.

| Skills   | Demand Count |
|----------|--------------|

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT skills, ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg),0) AS avg_salary_per_skill
FROM job_postings_fact p
JOIN skills_job_dim sj ON p.job_id = sj.job_id
JOIN skills_dim s on sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY avg_salary_per_skill DESC
LIMIT 25
```
